**ES6 Promises Project**

This project focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 Promises in JavaScript. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid grasp of how Promises work, their methods (`then`, `resolve`, `catch`), and how to handle asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand Promises: What they are, why they're used, and how to use them effectively.
- Master Promise methods: Learn to use `then`, `resolve`, `catch`, and `every` method of the Promise object.
- Error Handling: Explore error handling techniques using `throw`, `try`, and `catch`.
- Asynchronous Programming: Dive into asynchronous programming with the `await` operator and `async` functions.

**Requirements:**
- All files should be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- End each file with a new line.
- Include a mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Code should have `.js` extension.
- Test code using Jest (`npm run test`).
- Verify code against lint using ESLint.
- All functions must be exported.

**Setup:**
1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x using the provided script.
2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by running `npm install` in your project directory.

**Configuration Files:**
- `package.json`: Dependency management and project scripts.
- `babel.config.js`: Babel configuration for transpiling ES6 code.
- `utils.js`: Utility functions for tasks requiring `uploadPhoto` and `createUser`.
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for code linting.

**Response Data Format:**
- `uploadPhoto`: Returns a response with the format `{ status: 200, body: 'photo-profile-1' }`.
- `createUser`: Returns a response with the format `{ firstName: 'Guillaume', lastName: 'Salva' }`.

This project provides a hands-on learning experience in mastering ES6 Promises and asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Happy coding! ðŸš€
