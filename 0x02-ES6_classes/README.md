ES6 Classes Project
Overview
This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, specifically using ES6 classes. The objective is to deepen understanding of class definitions, method implementation, inheritance, and metaprogramming with symbols.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, participants are expected to gain proficiency in the following areas:

Defining classes in JavaScript using ES6 syntax
Adding methods to a class to encapsulate functionality
Understanding the purpose and implementation of static methods in classes
Extending a class from another to leverage inheritance
Exploring metaprogramming techniques and the use of symbols
Requirements
Environment
All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
Supported Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
All files should end with a new line
Tools
NodeJS 12.11.x is required for execution
Jest, Babel, and ESLint are necessary for testing and linting
Installation instructions are provided in the Setup section
Setup
